Overview
========

This is a program to create image tiles from a given image, that is suitable
for use in a DeepZoom[1] viewer, such as OpenSeadragon[2].

Basically it builds up a pyramid of tiles with each level being half the size
of its predecessor. Each level shows the same image, just at a different size.

See, [3] and [4] for details on this, having read Microsoft's documentation[5],
those proved to be indispensable.


Requirements
============

The only thing other than a C compiler is GraphicsMagick[6].

Usage
=====

$ deepzoom_tiler [-t tile size] [-o overlap] [-h] <image>

-t tile size is the size of the tiles to create. If you don't specify it, it
defaults to 256.

-o overlap is the number of pixels to overlap the tiles by, it defaults to 0
(no overlap)

-h prints the usage text.

image is the name of the image to tile.

For a quick start, do the following.

Create a directory, say deepzoom.
Download OpenSeadragon and stick its files in the above directory.
Put an image in the above directory.
Run '/path/to/deepzoom_tiler image.jpg' from the above directory.

That will create a directory called image_files and a file called image.dzi

Create an html file in the above directory, say openseadragon.html with the
following contents;

<html>
<head>
<script type = "text/javascript" src = "OpenSeadragon.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">
	var viewer = null;

	function init() {
		viewer1 = new Seadragon.Viewer("container");
		viewer1.openDzi("image.dzi");
	}

	Seadragon.Utils.addEvent(window, "load", init);
</script>

<style type = "text/css">
            #container
            {
                width: 400px;
                height: 400px;
                background-color: black;
                border: 1px solid black;
                color: white;   /* for error messages, etc. */
            }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div id = "container"></div>

</body>
</html>


Then open that html file in a browser and you should get a window showing your
image that you can pan and zoom. You can use the button controls or your
mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
